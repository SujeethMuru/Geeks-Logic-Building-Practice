# GeeksforGeek Logic Bulding Practice

This repo contains my **personal solutions** to [Logic-Building Problems on GeeksforGeeks] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/logic-building-problems/)

## About

The goal of this repo is to strengthen my logic building with out any asisstance

For each problem, I follow this approach:
- **Solve the problem myself first** using my own logic.
- **Then review the official GeeksforGeeks solution** and add it for comparison and deeper understanding.

---

## Repository Structure

Each file typically contains:
- My working solution (commented and tested)
- The corresponding GeeksforGeeks approach (with proper credit)

I may also include:
- Problem statements as comments
- Notes or optimizations I found while solving

## Credits

All problem statements and official reference solutiions belong to [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/logic-building-problems/)

This repository is **for educational purposes only** and is meant to:
- Track my progress,
- Reinforce learning, and
- Help others understand alternate solutions.
